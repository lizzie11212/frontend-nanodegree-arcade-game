# About the game
This is a game that is based on the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), where the player starts at the bottom of the board. The user has to move the player to the top of the board, over the road into the water, while avoiding enemies crossing the road. If the player is hit by one of the enemies, the game will be reset to the initial state. When the player succeeds crossing over the road into the water, the game will stop and the enemies will disappear.

# How to play this game
To move the character around use the arrow keys:
- left
- right
- up
- down

# Enemies üêû
The enemies comes in from the left, and there's one in each of the rows with pavement. The speed they move at is generated at random. When they leave the screen, their position gets reset so they will come back from the left. They will take a life from the player if hit.
